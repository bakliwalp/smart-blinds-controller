# Smart Blinds Controller
### IoT personal project to automate blinds that use a bead’s chain system. 

The controller is entirely 3D printed and the model was provided by user on thingiverse at this link https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2631414

#### The hardware was designed using the following components:

* **1** - Wemos D1 mini WiFi microcontroller
* **1** - 12V DC motor 40RPM for high torque
* **1** - L298N mini motor driver
* **2** - buttons (Up & Down)
* **1** - Red LED
* **1** - Green LED
* **1** - DC Barrel Power Jack
* **2** - 10kΩ resistors
* **2** - 220Ω resistors
* **1** - Prototyping Board
* **1** - 12V Power Supply

#### The code was developed using Arduino Embedded C to control the blinds manually or through the Blynk app.
