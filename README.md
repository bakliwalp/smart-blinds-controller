# Smart Blinds Controller
IoT personal project to automate blinds that use a beadâ€™s chain system. 

The controller is entirely 3D printed and the model was provided by user on thingiverse at this link https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2631414

The hardware was designed using a Wemos D1 mini WiFi microcontroller, 12 DC motor 40RPM for high torque, L298N mini motor driver, buttons, and status LEDs. 

The code was developed using Arduino Embedded C to control the blinds manually or through the Blynk app.
