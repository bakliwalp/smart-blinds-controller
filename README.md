# smart-blinds-controller
IoT personal project to automate blinds that use a beadâ€™s chain system. The controller is entirely 3D printed and the hardware was designed using a Wemos D1 mini WiFi microcontroller, DC motor &amp; driver, buttons, and status LEDs. The code was developed using Arduino Embedded C to control the blinds manually or through the Blynk app.
